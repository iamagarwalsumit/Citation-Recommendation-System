# Citation Recommendation based on citation contexts

In this project, we built a recommender system aimed at providing the most relevant citations corresponding to queried scientific article context. Popular informational retrieval algorithms like query expansion, spelling correction, BM25, tf-idf, latent sematic indexing, etc were used.

The project was part of the Information Retrieval Course. The final presentation of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/prabhat1081/Citation-Recommendation-based-on-citation-contexts/blob/master/IR-Presentation-Citation.pdf). Snapshots of the demo can be found [here](https://github.com/prabhat1081/Citation-Recommendation-based-on-citation-contexts/blob/master/IR-Snapshots-Citation.pdf).
